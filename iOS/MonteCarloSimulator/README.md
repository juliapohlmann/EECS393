To view the MonteCarloSimulator project, open the file named "MonteCarloSimulator.xcworkspace". 

It is important that you open this file and not the file named "MonteCarloSimulator.xcodeproj" as we are utilizing CocoaPods and the CocoaPod set-up is specified in the .xcworkspace file. 

To build, use ⌘ + B
To run, use an iPhone 6 simulator and use ⌘ + R
To test, use ⌘ + U

All code written is our own, some is generated from Storyboard in which we matched the designs submitted in the design document to the best of our ability. 

The only exception is in StockSelectionTableViewController.swift where we utilize the StocksKit CocoaPod method to get the real time value of a stock from Yahoo Finance. More can be found about this CocoaPod at https://cocoapods.org/pods/StocksKit
