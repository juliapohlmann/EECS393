Monte Carlo Stock Simulator v1.0

This Monte Carlo Simulator will allow users to create a portfolio of stocks and simulate its performance over time.  

The iOS App enables users to identify the probability that their portfolio will meet their financial goal after a set duration.  The initial portfolio value can be allocated across 15 to 100 different stocks.  Those stocks are then forecasted over the investment duration for 10,000 simulations.  The simulation returns the probability, in terms of number of successful trials, that the goal amount is reached.  

The Simulation is based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis.  Forecasted stock prices are a function of historical price drift and a ranom variable to mimic market volatility.  The simulation makes the assumption that stocks follow a random walk.  

The Monte Carlo Simulator is intended to be used for academic purposes.  It is a tool for those interested in investing to learn about portfolio allocation, compounding returns, and investing.   

For information on how to run the application, please consult the read me files in the subfolders for the server and client.
